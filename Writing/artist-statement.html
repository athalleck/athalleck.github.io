Artist Statement 
The screen is not just a blank canvas but a dynamic space where time, logic, and interaction are foundations in the work itself. Code allows me to create living systems, systems that evolve over time and respond to rules, randomness, and the surrounding environment. My process is a dialogue between myself and the code, a cycle of trial and error where each iteration builds on the last. 
I can either start a piece with a clear image in mind, and therefore, I have to figure out how to translate it into code—how to speak its language. Other times, I begin with the code itself, not knowing exactly where it will lead. Both approaches are part of my process, whether chasing a specific outcome or exploring blindly. This approach changes the computer from a tool to a collaborator, thus shifting my role between artist, curator, and viewer.
Randomness plays a vital role in my code. But to fully understand what this means, we need to know what I mean when I say randomness. True randomness does not exist in code; instead, I work with pseudo-randomness—structured unpredictability that mimics chance but is ultimately shaped by my decisions. I choose when and where randomness is placed in my code, controlling how much impact it has on the final result. 
The natural world informs both my visual language and my code. Simple rules generate complex results that parallel nature, where patterns emerge from seemingly random conditions. I use a camera to capture motion, noise, and environmental inputs, such as the viewer, to shape evolving visual compositions. Time itself becomes a variable, influencing the unfolding of generative forms. 
The tension between control and unpredictability mirrors our chaotic yet structured world. By inviting the viewer into this space, my work challenges them to find their own connections, highlighting the ways generative art reflects and interacts with our environment. It forces the viewer to not only experience the work but also become an active participant and, at some times, a performer within it. 
In this push-and-pull between intention and chance, creation and discovery, my work exists in a space where control is not absolute but a shifting force within an evolving system. What emerges is neither wholly dictated by my hand nor entirely left to chance, but a negotiation between structure and spontaneity that reflects the complexities of both art and life.
